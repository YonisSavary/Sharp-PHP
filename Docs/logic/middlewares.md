# ðŸš¦ Middlewares

Middlewares are class that are called just before your routes callback,
they can tell if a [`Request`](../../Classes/Http/Request.php) can access your route

A middleware is a class that implements [`MiddlewareInterface`](../../Classes/Web/MiddlewareInterface.php),
which got this main method :

```php
public static function handle(Request $request) : Request|Response;
```

- Returning a [`Request`](../../Classes/Http/Request.php) mean that your middleware assume the given request has access to the route.
- Returning a [`Response`](../../Classes/Http/Response.php) mean that the access is forbidden and the response is displayed to the user

## Need of middleware ?

This section is here to explain the need of middlewares to thoses who never used them

Let's imagine this situation, you are building your application, which got a
authentication system, your app have a few public routes, the rest is only accessible
for logged users

You may want to check if your user is logged in your controller callback:
```php
if (!userIsLogged())
    return Response::redirect("/login");
```

It takes 2 lines of code to redirect any user that is not logged, no big deal

Now let's assume you have 50 controller methods in your app, it's now 100 lines of code to write !
And if someday your authentication system change, you now have to edit/copy-paste 100 times your new code,
which is a very tedious task to do

Using middlewares, you can just write your class one time, apply it to every routes you want.
And the day it changes, you only have to edit your middleware class.
Also, middlewares can be combined to give different conditions
